# commitji
User interface to facilitate the creation of conventional commit messages, inspired by tools such as Commitizen and Gitmoji. The idea is to allow the user to choose a prefix (feat, fix, etc.) and a Gitmoji emoji, then insert them in an external text zone (for example, in an IDE like VS Code or a Git console).
